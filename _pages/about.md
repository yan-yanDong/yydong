I'm a postoc in the [School of Science and Engineering (SSE)](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK, Shenzhen)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). 

Prior to being a postdoc in CUHK,Shenzhen, I was a Research Fellow in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/ece/) at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) during Dec 2022 and Dec 2023, where I was hosted by Prof. [Vincent Y. F. Tan](https://vyftan.github.io/). 

I obtained my Ph.D. in 2022 from [School of Science and Engineering (SSE)](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK,Shenzhen)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en) with Prof. [Shenghao Yang](https://shhyang.github.io/) as my advisor. 

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/#) in July 2017.

Academic Service
======
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
