I'm a postoc in the [School of Science and Engineering (SSE)](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK, Shenzhen)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). 

Prior to being a postdoc in CUHK,Shenzhen, I was a Research Fellow in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/ece/) at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) during Dec 2022 and Dec 2023, where I was hosted by Prof. [Vincent Y. F. Tan](https://vyftan.github.io/). 

I obtained my Ph.D. in 2022 from [School of Science and Engineering (SSE)](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK,Shenzhen)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en) with Prof. [Shenghao Yang](https://shhyang.github.io/) as my advisor. 

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/#) in July 2017.
